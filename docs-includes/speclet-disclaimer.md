> [!NOTE]
> This article is a feature specification. The specification represents the *proposed* feature specification. There may be some discrepancies between the feature specification and the completed implementation. Those differences are captured in the pertinent [language design meeting (LDM) notes](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/tree/main/meetings). Links to pertinent meetings are included at the bottom of the spec. You can learn more about the process for merging feature speclets into the C# language standard in the article on the [specifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/specifications).
