# C# Language Design Notes for Feb 28, 2018

***Warning: These are raw notes, and still need to be cleaned up. Read at your own peril!***

Parameters: Value parameters can be treated like locals, but we may not want to. Ref and out parameters need to be guarded by non-W warnings.

Is it a problem that this can lead to two related warnings? Maybe a little bit, but it's actually mostly good. You can address the declaraion of s2 in three differen ways:

* Make ns non-null before assigning
* Put a questionmark on s2
* Turn of W warnings
Would be weird if that last one introduced another warning!

Type inference:

We could have `var` always have `?`. 

``` c#
    static T[] MakeStack<T>(T element)
    {

    }
    static int GetLengthOfMiddleName(Person p)
    {
        string? middleName = p.MiddleName;

        //return middleName.Length;
        if (middleName is null) return 0;
        var stack = MakeStack(middleName); // infer string[] or string?[]
    }


        bool b = false;
        string s = null; // suppressable
        var s2 =
            //(b ? s : s);
            Choose(b, s, s);
        var l = s2.Length; // not suppressable

```

Should we have type inference depend on the declared or the flowed type state? We reiterated that discussion, but conclude (again) that it's the null state that counts. This maximally helps avoid unnecessary warnings on legacy code.

## Cast and non-null

``` c#
var s1 = "Hello"; // But I want to assign null later
var s2 = (string?)"Hello"; // Either disallowed, makes no difference or forgets null state
var? s3 = "Hello"; // Nullable but keeps the null state
```

So `var?` would be more useful than casts for `var` scenarios (because you are declaring a variable whose null state matters later). For generic arguments it doesn't matter to keep the flow state, so `(string?)` cast works fine.

It's a little weird that `s2` and `s3` don't work quite the same way. They do today.

Still, as a plan of record let's do this.

So we keep the casts, and tentatively keep `var?`.
