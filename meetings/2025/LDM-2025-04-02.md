### User Defined Compound Assignment Operators

Champion issue: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/9101  
Specification: [User Defined Compound Assignment Operators.](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/f0c692748ee5067fd59ed0ece46d79a408fe50d0/proposals/user-defined-compound-assignment.md)  
Discussion: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/discussions/9100

#### Should readonly modifier be allowed in structures?

Question: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/f0c692748ee5067fd59ed0ece46d79a408fe50d0/proposals/user-defined-compound-assignment.md#should-readonly-modifier-be-allowed-in-structures

Our first topic today is about whether we should allow a `readonly` modifier for compound assignments. The current specification requires the target of the operator to be a variable. In some cases, these could be beneficial - such as in wrapper classes that expose a subset of a type's surface. Also, there was concern about `readonly` structs needing to have all members `readonly`.

Full support would require additional design work. 

##### Conclusion

We will allow `readonly` modifiers, but we will not relax the target requirements at this time.

#### Should shadowing be allowed

Question: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/f0c692748ee5067fd59ed0ece46d79a408fe50d0/proposals/user-defined-compound-assignment.md#should-shadowing-be-allowed

We discussed that the implementation of user-defined operators is via methods and that behavior that did not match methods may seem strange.

##### Conclusion

Shadowing will be allowed with the same rules as methods.

#### Should we have any consistency enforcement between declared += and + operators?

Question: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/f0c692748ee5067fd59ed0ece46d79a408fe50d0/proposals/user-defined-compound-assignment.md#should-we-have-any-consistency-enforcement-between-declared--and--operators

This was a follow-up on concerns raised in [LDM-2025-02-12](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/meetings/2025/LDM-2025-02-12.md#user-defined-instance-based-operators). Authors may accidentally push their users into odd scenarios where a += may work, but + won't (or vice versa) because one form declares extra operators than the other.

There were concerns about enforcing such a rule.

##### Conclusion

Checks will _not_ be done on consistency between different forms of operators.

### Readonly setters

Champion issue: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/9174  
Specification: [Readonly setter calls on non-variables](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/e34ecf622058b53f0fb37705baa8597ea045d378/proposals/readonly-setter-calls-on-non-variables.md)  
Discussion: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/discussions/2068

#### Expansions

Question: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/e34ecf622058b53f0fb37705baa8597ea045d378/proposals/readonly-setter-calls-on-non-variables.md#expansions

There are cases where it is appropriate to error if a non-readonly setter is called, that may be reasonable when a `readonly` setter is called. We explored two of those cases that currently error with _CS1918 Member of property ... cannot be assigned with an object initializer because it is of a value type._ Should we include allowing readonly setters in these cases as part of the broader feature.

A change would be needed to the C# spec on object initializers ([ยง12.8.16.3](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/standard-v7/standard/expressions.md#128163-object-initializers)), which will be added to this proposal.

It was noted that expansions could be split off and done after the rest of the work in this proposal.

##### Conclusion

We will include expansions in the _Readonly Setter calls on non-variables_ proposal
