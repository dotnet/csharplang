<!--
Hello, and thanks for your interest in contributing to C#! If you haven't been invited by a team member to open an issue, please instead open a discussion marked [draft issue] at https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/discussions/new and we'll try to give you feedback on how to get to an issue-ready proposal.

New language feature proposals should fully fill out this template. This should include a complete detailed design, which describes the syntax of the feature, what that syntax means, and how it affects current parts of the spec. Please make sure to point out specific spec sections that need to be updated for this feature.

# FEATURE_NAME

* [x] Proposed
* [ ] Prototype: Not Started
* [ ] Implementation: Not Started

## Summary
[summary]: #summary

<!-- One paragraph explanation of the feature. -->

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

<!-- Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome? -->

## Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

<!-- This is the bulk of the proposal. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the language to understand, and for somebody familiar with the compiler to implement, and include examples of how the feature is used. Please include syntax and desired semantics for the change, including linking to the relevant parts of the existing C# spec to describe the changes necessary to implement this feature. An initial proposal does not need to cover all cases, but it should have enough detail to enable a language team member to bring this proposal to design if they so choose. -->

## Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks
