# Attributes on local functions

[!INCLUDE[Specletdisclaimer](../speclet-disclaimer.md)]

Champion issue: <https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/1888>

## Attributes

Local function declarations are now permitted to have attributes ([ยง22](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/attributes.md#22-attributes)). Parameters and type parameters on local functions are also allowed to have attributes.

Attributes with a specified meaning when applied to a method, its parameters, or its type parameters will have the same meaning when applied to a local function, its parameters, or its type parameters, respectively.

A local function can be made conditional in the same sense as a conditional method ([ยง22.5.3](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/attributes.md#2253-the-conditional-attribute)) by decorating it with a `[ConditionalAttribute]`. A conditional local function must also be `static`. All restrictions on conditional methods also apply to conditional local functions, including that the return type must be `void`.

## Extern

The `extern` modifier is now permitted on local functions. This makes the local function external in the same sense as an external method ([ยง15.6.8](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/classes.md#1468-external-methods)).

Similarly to an external method, the *local-function-body* of an external local function must be a semicolon. A semicolon *local-function-body* is only permitted on an external local function. 

An external local function must also be `static`.

## Syntax

The [ยง13.6.4](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/statements.md#1364-local-function-declarations), or [local functions grammar](../csharp-7.0/local-functions.md#syntax-grammar) is modified as follows:

```
local-function-header
    : attributes? local-function-modifiers? return-type identifier type-parameter-list?
        ( formal-parameter-list? ) type-parameter-constraints-clauses
    ;

local-function-modifiers
    : (async | unsafe | static | extern)*
    ;

local-function-body
    : block
    | arrow-expression-body
    | ';'
    ;
```
