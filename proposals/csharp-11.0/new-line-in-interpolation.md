# Allow new-lines in all interpolations

[!INCLUDE[Specletdisclaimer](../speclet-disclaimer.md)]

* [x] Proposed
* [x] Implementation: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/56853
* [x] Specification: this file.

## Summary
[summary]: #summary

The language today treats non-verbatim and verbatim interpolated strings (`$""` and `$@""` respectively) differently.  The primary *sensible* difference for these is that a non-verbatim interpolated string works like a normal string and cannot contain newlines in its text segments, and must instead use escapes (like `\r\n`).  Conversely, a verbatim interpolated string can contain newlines in its text segments (like a verbatim string), and doesn't escape newlines or other character (except for `""` to escape a quote itself).

This is all reasonable and will not change with this proposal.

What is unreasonable today is that we extend the restriction on 'no newlines' in a non-verbatim interpolated string *beyond* its text segments into the *interpolations* themselves.  This means, for example, that you cannot write the following:

```c#
var v = $"Count is\t: { this.Is.A.Really(long(expr))
                            .That.I.Should(
                                be + able)[
                                    to.Wrap()] }.";
```

Ultimately, the 'interpolation must be on a single line itself' rule is just a restriction of the current implementation.  That restriction really isn't necessary, and can be annoying, and would be fairly trivial to remove (see work https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/54875 to show how).   In the end, all it does is force the dev to place things on a single line, or force them into a verbatim interpolated string (both of which may be unpalatable).

The interpolation expressions themselves are not text, and shouldn't be beholden to any escaping/newline rules therin.
