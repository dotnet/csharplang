# Ignored directives

[!INCLUDE[Specletdisclaimer](../speclet-disclaimer.md)]

Champion issue: <https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/8617>

## Summary

Add `#:` directive prefix to be used by tooling, but ignored by the language.

```cs
#!/usr/bin/dotnet run
#:sdk      Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web
#:property TargetFramework=net11.0
#:property LangVersion=preview
#:package  System.CommandLine@2.0.0-*

Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

## Motivation

We are adding `dotnet run file.cs` support [in .NET SDK][dotnet-run-file].
Real-world file-based programs need to reference NuGet packages.
It would be also useful if it were possible to execute file-based programs directly like `./file.cs` when they have [the shebang directive][shebang] (`#!`).

The language should ignore these directives, but compiler implementations and other tooling can recognize them.
We already have similar directives in the language:
- `#region`
- `#pragma`: details are implementation specific
- `#error version`: the `version` part is not in the spec, but Roslyn will report its version

## Detailed design

Introduce new *ignored pre-processing directives* ([ยง6.5][directives]):

```antlr
PP_Kind
    : ... // Existing directive kinds
    | PP_Ignored
    ;

PP_Ignored
    : PP_IgnoredToken Input_Character*
    ;

PP_IgnoredToken
    : '!'
    | ':'
    ;
```

These are parsed regardless of language version.

### Restrictions

Ignored directives must occur before the first token ([ยง6.4][tokens]) in the compilation unit, just like `#define`/`#undef` directives.
This improves readability (all package references and other configuration is in one place), tooling performance (no need to scan long files in full).
Ignored directives must also occur before any `#if` directives because the tooling might not know the full set of conditional compilation symbols while parsing ignored directives.

Furthermore, the compiler should report a warning if the `#!` directive is not placed at the first line and the first character in the file
(not even a BOM marker can be in front of it), because otherwise shells won't recognize it.

Compilers are also free to report errors if these directives are used in unsupported scenarios,
e.g., Roslyn will report an error if these directives are present in a file compiled as part of "project-based programs" as opposed to "file-based programs"
(and tooling will remove these directives when migrating file-based programs to project-based programs).
If needed, we might consider not reporting that error for the `#!` directive, as it might invoke some other tool than `dotnet run`, so there is no need to restrict it to scripts and file-based programs only.

Similarly, the compiler or SDK should still error/warn on unrecognized directives to "reserve" them for future use by the official .NET tooling.

## Alternatives

### Separate directives instead of one ignored prefix

We could add each ignored directive to the language instead of introducing one ignored prefix.
- For `dotnet run file.cs` specifically, we might want to add only as few directives as possible,
  and for anything more advanced, recommend users to eject to project-based programs instead
  (i.e., avoid having two ways to configure everything).
- In any case, it might be good if new directives are discussed and approved by the language design team
  since they are part of the overall C# language experience.

```cs
#!/usr/bin/dotnet run
#sdk      Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web
#property TargetFramework=net11.0
#property LangVersion=preview
#package  System.CommandLine@2.0.0-*
#something // unrecognized directives would still be required by the language spec to be an error

Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

### Other syntax forms

Other syntax forms could be used except for shebang which shells recognize only by `#!`.

#### Pragma

We could reuse `#pragma` directive although that's originally meant for compiler options, not SDK (project-wide) options.

```cs
#pragma package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 4.14.0
```

#### Single directive

We could introduce only a single new directive for everything (packages, sdks, and possibly more in the future).
For example, `#r` is already supported by C# scripting and other existing tooling.
However, the naming of the directive is less clear.

```cs
#r "nuget: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis, 4.14.0"
```

#### Sigil

We could reserve another sigil prefix (e.g., `#!`/`#@`/`#$`) for any directives that should be ignored by the language.
Note that `#!` would be interpreted as shebang by shells if it is at the first line of the file.

```cs
#!/usr/bin/dotnet run
##package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 4.14.0
```

#### Comments

We could use comments instead of introducing new directives.
Reusing normal comments with `//#` might be confused with directives that have been commented out unless we use some other syntax like `//!` but both of these could be breaking.
Documentation XML comments are more verbose and we would need to ensure they do not apply to the class below them when placed at the top of the file.

```cs
//#package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 4.14.0
```

```cs
/// <package name="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis" version="4.14.0" />
```
